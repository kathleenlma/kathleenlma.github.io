“you are not required to fight fires” is a show about authority voices, instructions, blame, and individual vs. collective responsibility. The exhibition consists of audio-visual installations, poetry, and diagram installations. Using the rhetoric and visual language of Microsoft Powerpoint, stock images, instructional videos, and LinkedIn poetry, I reach for what is subjective and emancipatory.
