**(print club!) explores the relationship between image, machine, face and body.**

When you enter a purikura center, you are confronted with the faces of the women you could be. They are stunning, and you are surrounded. The photo sticker booth will convert fantasy into reality for 400 yen. You can pick which one you want. You put four coins into the slot. Your body is engulfed by another body. The body spits you back out in 6 small frames. 

You retrieve this small reality. It is exactly what you wanted.
