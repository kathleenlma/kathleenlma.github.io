Album cover artwork for The Tigertones, one of Princeton's oldest a capella groups. The album artwork is a homage to the Tigertones' rich history and timeless tunes. I chose not to display any of the member's faces in the photographs, so that it could be Tigertones from any time, in any place, going forward together. 


The album is available on Spotify [here](https://play.spotify.com/album/39qDe439KDt38HU7Nwz7j7?play=true&utm_source=open.spotify.com&utm_medium=open).
