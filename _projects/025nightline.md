I was tasked with the identity and print design of Princeton Peer Nightline, a phone line where students can call from 9 pm - 2 am and talk with trained student volunteers. This new program is part of the Princeton's Mental Health Initiative. Mental health resources on campus have been very good to me, so I was excited to contribute to this new initiative.

A list of descriptors served as a launching point for my explorations: Supportive, Accessible, Welcoming and After Hours.

Several key concepts emerged from these explorations: images that represented communication and connectivity cropped up frequently (for example -- nodes and signal bars), as well as circular shapes.

For these iterations above, I looked at how nodes, signal bars, and the crescent moon could be incorporated together in a circular graphic. During these explorations, I thought nodes were too abstract and impersonal, while images of a phone seemed too on the nose.

The final logo is inspired by connectivity and nighttime. The individual components of the logo come together to form a circular whole, echoing the goals of the initiative -- you may feel alone at times, but you are part of something larger. And you are most definitely not alone.
