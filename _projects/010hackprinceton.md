I was design director for HackPrinceton Spring 2016, Fall 2016, and Spring 2017. I created the web design, branding and other visual assets for each of these hackathons, and contributed to the interaction design. 


#### **Spring 2016**

I designed the website, branding materials and style guidelines for HackPrinceton Spring 2016.

The style choices emphasize boldness, playfulness and exploration. The primary color palette draws inspiration from the CMYK color model, and allows for a wide range of uses. 

We used mostly rounded objects, which embody the hackathon's friendly nature. The style guide also invites further possibilities for interesting uses of white space and space objects (rockets?! spaceships?! astronauts lost in space?!)
