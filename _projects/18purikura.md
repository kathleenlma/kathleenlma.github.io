When you enter a purikura center, you are confronted with the faces of the women you could be. The photo sticker booth will convert fantasy into reality for 400 yen. You can pick which one you want. You put four coins into the slot. Your body is engulfed by another body. It spits you back out in 6 small frames. 

You retrieve the photos. It is exactly what you wanted.
