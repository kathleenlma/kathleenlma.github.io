		<p>As an intern for the San Francisco Planning Department, I made a process guide for the tactical urbanism program Groundplay. Groundplay works with San Franciscans to build temporary installations that turn underused public spaces into joyful community places.</p>

		<p>Although Groundplay advocates for a community-lead process, asymmetric information and complex planning processes can make this difficult. I designed this resource guide to lower barriers to community participation, and help the public navigate top-down, government planning projects more effectively.</p></div>

		<div class="h8">PROBLEM</div>

			<p>(1) On Groundplay's website, there is limited information on a project's process. The "Resources" tab has comprehensive guides such as the San Francisco Parklet Manual and the Public Stewardship Guide. However, these guides don't provide a high-level view of the process.</p>
			<p>(2) Furthermore, essential information IS NOT ON THE WEBSITE, but it is places like the Public Works website.</p>

		<p>Resource guide that was simple enough to provide a high-level overview of the process, but also link to internal and external resource that would provide more in depth information.</p>

Goal: MAKE SOMETHING COOL.

To see what kind of questions community members had, I sat in on consultations with Groundplay and interviewed Groundplay staff. I developed a [   ], and attempted to diagram the process.

		<p>It works as a paper handout, but doesn't translate well into a web-based version, and doesn't lead to mostly web-based resources. After layoutting the process, Groundplay staff and community members thought that the flowchart was confusing and non-intuitive. It lacked _______. 

		<p>With this feedback in consideration, I made my second iteration an interactive walkthrough of the process. The guide asks questions such as: "have you talked to the community that this project will impact?" and "what kinds of projects are you interested in?"</p>

		<p>This resource guide included links to permitting applications, information on ADA requirements, examples of stewardship models, and examples of projects.
