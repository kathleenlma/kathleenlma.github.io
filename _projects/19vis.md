[Eric Li](http://eric.young.li) and I designed the website for Princeton's [Visual Arts Program](http://arts.princeton.edu/academics/visual-arts/), and Eric built it in Wordpress. We envisioned a website where students could directly share their work and events in the program. 

You can view the website at [vis.princeton.edu](http://vis.princeton.edu)

Artists can customize their individual pages to reflect their own work, influences and style. We wanted the pages to be flexible, with enough constraints to make choices easy. Students use their pages as artists profiles, spaces for new work, and idea dumping grounds.
