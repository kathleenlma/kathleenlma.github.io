Monstera Tenuis is a interactive and educational web explorable, telling the story of a vine that is attracted to the darkness. I contributed to the art direction, storyboarding, and design.

I made concept sketches for the visuals of the interactive story. The challenge was to immerse the viewer in a rainforest environment, and to convey the atmospheric quality of our fictional forest -- while keeping the story legible at the same time. 

Viewers can scroll through the story text, which is overlaid on the rainforest scenes.

>Imagine youâ€™re in a rainforest in Costa Rica, and you come across a great big trunk of a tree. You look down at the ground, and among the brown mix of roots and leaves you can clearly make out hundreds of little green lines, like arrow markers that surround the tree and point towards its base.
