I was tasked with the branding and web design of Hack Lagos Traffic, a Big Data Masterclass tackling one of Lagos' most challenging problems—traffic. The event consisted of a tutorial session and an interactive coding & design workshop. Ultimately, the goals of the conference are to: 
* Give like-minded, socially responsible Nigerians a platform to learn, collaborate and contribute
* Promote citizen-government partnership in solving key social issues

The goals of the website are to:
* Convince viewers of the value of the workshop AND GET THEM TO SIGN UP
* Convey to viewers the severity of the problem and that they can play a part in helping fix it
* GIVE INFORMATION ABOUT THE MASTERCLASS TO APPLICANTS AND PARTICIPANTS

I designed the website of the last Hack Lagos Traffic under time constraints and was ultimately unsatisfied with the final product. This year, I thought I would revisit the old designs to consider what went well, and what could be improved on.

Some of the things I noticed:
1. Inconsistency:
	* Inconsistent use of color and graphic elements 
2. Lack of focal points:
	* Landing page is uninformative and doesn’t grab the viewer’s attention 
	* None of the pages have a visual focal point for the user to look at 
	* Stock images that were low quality, distracting, and making text less legible rather than contributing new visual information. 
3. No call to actions
	* Doesn’t give user sense of urgency / sense that this is an opportunity that they shouldn’t pass up on 
4. Unclear registration
	* Confusing registration process 

I kept these in mind going forward with the design process. 





# Visual identity / branding 

### GOALS: 
Friendly design, to make it clear that anyone can apply, that you don’t need experience to participate, that this isn’t just an event for professionals — that all citizens have a role and a stake in social issues. Important to convey inclusivity and encouragement. 

##### RESEARCH: 
I did research on transportation in Lagos to see what are the means of transit, some transportation issues. I looked at Lagos city.

##### STYLE GUIDE

![Hack Lagos Traffic Color](/img/traffic/color-scheme.jpg)

One of the only things I carried over from last year’s design is the bold yellow / gray / black color scheme, which evoke Lagos’ iconic yellow buses.







#### Web / interaction design (experience?)

##### GOALS: 
Easy application, on boarding, especially for people who are unfamiliar with hackathons 

USER TESTING / RESEARCH:

(NOT SURE WHAT TO CALL THIS, BUT PHRASES LIKE...) I want to be able to check the schedule of the event on my phone
I want to be able to know where I am in the registration process


##### SITE ARCHITECTURE:

##### DASHBOARD:
Easy on boarding and registration process
Platform hosts information only for the participant, to keep the home page more streamlined (more detailed schedule w/ locations for various events)
