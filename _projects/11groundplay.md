		<p>As an intern for the San Francisco Planning Department, I made a process guide for the tactical urbanism program Groundplay. Groundplay works with San Franciscans to build temporary installations that turn underused public spaces into joyful community places.</p>

		<p>Although Groundplay advocates for a community-lead process, asymmetric information and complex planning processes can make this difficult. I designed this resource guide to lower barriers to community participation, and help the public navigate top-down, government planning projects more effectively.</p>

		<p>This resource guide included links to permitting applications, information on ADA requirements, examples of stewardship models, and examples of projects. I wanted to make a guide that was simple enough to provide a high-level overview of the process, but provide more in-depth information through links to internal and external resources.
