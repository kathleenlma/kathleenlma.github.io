Strategies for Success Seminar explores an archive of success seminars, self-help, therapy and meditation tapes, borrowing and blending their logics and language. Hovering between the nonsensical, satirical, and deeply sincere, the piece invites the participant to consider
the breakdown of authority voices, and blurring between personal and political. Through a series of video modules, it provides methods for the participant to understand their own problems, fears, and barriers to success. </p>
