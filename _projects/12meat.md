<p>"bouncy cancel" is a series of 3d-modeled books. The books of "bouncy cancel" are constructed in ways that are nonsensical and frivolous: they have missing hinges and spines, they move in unexpected ways, their pages are playful and uneasy or composed entirely of negative space. I made these books when I didn't have access to the physical books I had created, and when it occurred to me that no one else really would, either. It was a pleasure to make books that disobey, that defy, that don't know what to do with themselves, that are playful and utterly useless. </p>

<p>"MEATBOOK" encloses my poem "skinsuit."</p>

<p>"如何成为渣女" or "how to be a scum girl" is a bubble book.</p>
