I was tasked with the identity and print design of Princeton Peer Nightline, a phone line where students can call from 9 pm - 2 am and talk with trained student volunteers.

The final logo is inspired by connectivity and nighttime. The individual components of the logo come together to form a circular whole, echoing the goals of the initiative.
