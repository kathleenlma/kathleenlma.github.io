For this Graphic Design: Typography class, I phototypeset László Maholy-Nagy's *New Typography* to express a point of view.

The ideas of *New Typography* included asymmetrical composition, sans serif typeface, preference for lowercase type, and the use of photography. 

This text was typeset with scissors, the printed text, photocopies of Maholy-Nagy's work, and a photocopier.
